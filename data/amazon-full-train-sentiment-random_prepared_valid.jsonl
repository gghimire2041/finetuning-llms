{"prompt":"Has some nice new features, but I'm glad I kept my 2012 KFHD too!\n\nThis new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on\/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps\/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Kindle vs. Nook (updated)\n\nUPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Some nice surprises\n\nThis was a birthday gift from my daughter. (71st birthday--certified old guy) What might I do with an Echo I bought a 3 Kindle book on using an Echo. Later I discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps, but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what I need to search out, and a Kindle book makes it easy for me to make notes I can find later with ease.I am using my Echo primarily as a radio. In the early 1990s I worked on my German skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio. Most of that is now on the Internet. I could listen on my smart phone, but that uses phone battery reserves. The Echo runs on AC power from a wall outlet. The little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts. I listen for hours to German news magazines. I can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from Radio Canada.We live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial. But, our WiFi reaches my garage workshop and I have clear audio through Tune In. (I am having trouble linking iHeart Radio, perhaps because my subscription is not paid.)When I have asked Alexa a question she sometimes tells me she cannot answer a question I thought simple enough.I did ask for some music and was surprised to find CDs I bought as gifts are in Amazon's cloud for me to hear over Echo.

Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media \/ web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12\/21\/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}
{"prompt":"Awesome Headphones! Longevity An Issue 750 of 777 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nWhile I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not 500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the 200 price tag. I might pay the 15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening.

One is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and I have not had any issues with them. Since I have not upgraded in 2 years I thought I would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster CPU and a higher resolution display.

I didn't feel the need to purchase a Kindle Fire every year and when I purchased the next one I wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what I had. I stayed with the 7 inch size as I like to portability and weight for long term reading. I alternate between the Kindle Paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and I use the Kindle Fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email. This new Kindle Fire HD 2014 version is very fast and easy to use. Setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze. I like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books.

Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nHaving received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy\/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently.

{"prompt":"Insanely good budget tablet 1,\n\nAll right so I was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars. One such was that the tablet weighed a whole 3 oz more and that resulted in a 3 star review. Let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous. It says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing. The other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen. That's why you get a cheap and good tablet. It even says in the discription that there will be ads on the lock screen. It takes a second to swipe up and unlock the screen. So the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit-pick.This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review.Buy this tablet if you want a cheap e-reader that can also sure the web, watch movies and shows, check Facebook or Twitter, or read books on. Ignore the negative reviews and you won't be disappointed.\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}
{"prompt":"Nice Tablet with Sharp Display 4,258 of 4,602 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nTo sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool \/ toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nI bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people.

{"prompt":"A nice case that works well to protect your tablet!\n\nThis is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 Kindle Fire. Inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your Kindle into. The frame solidly holds your Kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. The case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.The exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. It is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. The one in my video is marine blue. The top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.The cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. I like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. The inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.I like that the micro SD card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. That helps to protect the SD card from being lost or quickly stolen. A large memory size SD card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.The tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. I show this in my product video. All of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. That includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on\/off button.The cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the Internet or watching movies.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 4.0"}

Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media \/ web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12\/21\/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 3.0"}
{"prompt":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! SO HAPPY!! 1,\n\nI don't know why there are so many bad reviews. First of, let's start off by pointing out the obvious, it's under 100. You're not going to receive a Kindle Paperwhite. Before you order, read the specs and compare it to the other Kindles. Yes, the specs say it doesn't have backlighting so honestly, there shouldn't be one ounce of surprise when you receive this. I on the other hand, love this little Kindle. I have had the new Kindle Paperwhite and I really didn't like how big it was to hold in my small hands. I don't have children hands, but I'm a female and my hands are on the small side. Maybe for a male this would be kind of small, Idk. Anyway, it is smaller than the Paperwhite, but I love that. I also love the fact that it doesn't come with a light. I used to read at night with the Paperwhite, but that light gave me a headache so I stopped. It is NOT as dark as these bad reviews make it seem. You can read perfectly fine being indoors. They're exaggerating. This feels more like a book to me than the Kindle Paperwhite ever did. The letters on this Kindle are amazing. I don't even notice the difference between ppi and I love that the letters are way darker than the Paperwhite. The paperwhite had a grey hue to them and I didn't feel like I was reading a book. I felt like I actually holding a technical device to read a book. Of course since this doesn't have a backlight, you cannot read in the dark. It's common sense. If you want to read at night, purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindle. It's not a big deal and you're not going to break the bank buying a 119.99 item when you can buy this little awesome e-book reader for 79.99. Think about when the light runs out of your expensive other e-books...Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Unreal performance for 99! I couldn't be happier. 5,821 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nI'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}
{"prompt":"Worth the money. Not perfect, but very very good for start to finish novels in good light 11,965 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nThe Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 3.0"}

It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy\/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently.

{"prompt":"The single best value Fire in the entire line. Skip the Fire 7 and get the Fire 6 instead! 10,179 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nIf you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback\/paperback counterparts.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 4.0"}

I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised.

{"prompt":"The state of the art e-ink reader but is it worth the money to upgrade 13,\n\nAlthough I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go.

{"prompt":"A couple of downsides\n\nI bought this to supplement my OTHER streaming devices. I already have a Sony Google TV, which supports the Amazon Prime Streaming and YouTube etc. It connects to my TV using the HDMI. AND I have an Android tablet that lets me connect through the HDMI to my TV.The reason I bought the FIRE TV was I was under the impression I could use it to download Apps, (which is sort of true), and the App I wanted to use was the Xfinity TV GO. I have it on my Android Tablet, but since it's wi-fi only, it suffers a lot from stutters and stops etc. So I figured since the FIRE TV connects to my CAT-5\/LAN, I would have a faster connection.FIRST GRIPE - When I get the FIRE, first thing I tried to find was the Xfinity App. It wasn't on the FIRE's Menu at all. Then I got on Amazon's site, and found it on Amazon's App Store, but there's a great big RED X next to the app, saying It's not compatible - D R A TSECOND GRIPE. No matter what I've tried to do, I cannot figure out how to limit my browsing of movies and TV Shows to ONLY show Prime eligible content. On my SONY Goggle TV, the app that came with it lets me filter out the content so that only my Prime Membership Free Streaming shows up in my search results. IMHO, this a less than subtle method of forcing you to make a buying decision every time you look for content. I don't know which is worse, no filters or embedded advertising.THIRD GRIPE - The APP store is extremely limited. There's just a little over 100 apps available. Considering this is an Android device, and the Android Play Store probably has well over 10,000 apps.... that's very poor APP support.OH YES, Either I couldn't find it, or THERE IS NO WEB BROWSER.It seems that everyone that makes one of these devices, has their own little world that they support, and they try to block out every one else that could be competition. The end result is the Consumer ends up paying the penalty. AMAZON needs to wake up - Not everyone is in love with Amazon.Yes, for a first timer, The Fire is a reasonably slick device to own, but I simply can't see the point in keeping the FIRE. It's so extremely limited as compared to a REAL Android device, and everything it does is already duplicated on one of my OTHER devices.I am sending it back for a refund.\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}
{"prompt":"Awesome Headphones! Longevity An Issue 716 of 742 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nWhile I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them...\n\nI bought these for a couple of reasons.br \/br \/First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.br \/br \/Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.br \/br \/Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 4.0"}

Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me.

If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}
{"prompt":"I wanted to like this tablet...ended up somewhat disappointed 3,\n\nI bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 3.0"}
{"prompt":"GREAT update for those who use their Kindle a lot!\n\nI'm a long time Kindle user, and have upgraded a number of times. Every upgrade was a significant improvement, and the Oasis continues that trend. I love my Voyage, but the Oasis makes it feel like a hardback book. The pictures and descriptions don't do the size and weight justice. Shockingly light, and small even with the case. Used without the case, it's like holding a few sheets of paper. Amazing. Haven't had it long enough to evaluate the battery life, but never had a problem with the previous models, so I assume the promise of much longer battery life (with the secondary battery in the case) is accurate.The balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good. With the case feels a bit like the Voyage (although quite a bit lighter than my Voyage in its case). Case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed. Screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my Voyage (maybe due to the updated lighting system).I had the 'pressure sensitive' page turner option on my Voyage turned off. Much too jumpy and sensitive, even at its 'hard' setting. I won't miss that. The new mechanical buttons on the Oasis are AWESOME. Nice upgrade there, and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part.Yes, it is pricey. I would say if you are a 'few hour a week' reader, the Paperwhite is your best bet (solid performance and very good price\/value). But if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day (like me!), the extra battery life and the balance\/size\/weight, along with the slightly improved screen is WELL worth the money, especially when spread over the life of the unit.Edit: A few more comments now that I've been using the Oasis for a number of months.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Awesome Headphones! Longevity An Issue\n\nWhile I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Ive loved both my Paperwhite and Voyage is the Oasis worth the additional cost\n\nNote: My original Kindle Oasis review was posted on 4\/29\/16 on this product page on Amazon: New - Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover. This page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the U.S. My original review follows.UPDATE 7\/24\/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w\/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}
{"prompt":"Not the perfect do-it-all device, but very close to being the perfect e-reading device!\n\nI woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended\/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}
{"prompt":"Worth the money. Not perfect, but very very good for start to finish novels in good light\n\nThe Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.br \/br \/My overall impression of the device is good.br \/br \/The good:br \/I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.br \/br \/The so-so:br \/The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look.

{"prompt":"Works great with one critical flaw. (significantly improved)\n\nHaving received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy\/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Update 7\/21\/2014:The latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for Amazon Prime members - addressing most of my original complaints.Now that there is an entire section dedicated to Prime content, it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content. I wouldn't mind seeing more 'categories' to search through, but don't want to diminish the improvement.It's still not possible to search and return only Prime content. I think it should be possible to tell the device (when you search) that you only want returns from what is available for free to Prime members.The new 'Music' option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point. Not sure why it was added, but I hope it grows into a useful feature given the new Prime Music package.I would also like to see some sort of DLNA feature added. As one who rips all content that I buy (blu rays, dvds, cds) to a computer on my Network, I would very much like to be able to stream this material to the FireTV. Adding support for a connected USB device is not a solution for me. I have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material. Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 4.0"}
{"prompt":"I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them... 376 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nI bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and\/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9\/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 4.0"}
{"prompt":"Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition 6,421 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nThis is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-media\/product-gallery\/B00DOPNO4M\/).Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

{"prompt":"Amazon Tap Review - Best Bluetooth Speaker in its Category 2,\n\nThe Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look.

Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary.

{"prompt":"Great basic tablet for Amazon fans 9,\n\nAs a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the NEW Fire HD 8 released on September 21, 2016 from the perspective of being a long-term Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation), the old Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10. Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon has replaced the original HD 8 released in 2015 with an All-New HD 8. Amazon is also removing the Fire HD6, which is a shame as it is a great little tablet.The new HD 8 differs from the old version as follows:BEST NEW FEATURE:The price has been reduced! The 16 GB version of the old device cost 169.99 with special offers (ads). The new 16 GB version costs 89.99 and you can get a 32 HB version for 30 more.SECRETLY REMOVED:Amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on Miracast devices such as TVs. Now that feature is now only available on generation 4 and 5 Fires including last years HD 8. However, you can still cast Prime videos to a FireTV or Fire Stick.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:The HD8 Fire, a short 3-foot USB cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box.SIZE:The new HD8 is a fraction thicker than the 2015 HD8. Leather cases for the old HD 8 will fit the new HD 8 but hard shell cases will not. However the auto wake feature of some older cases won't work.One complaint I had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

{"prompt":"Awesome Headphones! Longevity An Issue 822 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nWhile I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 3.0"}

The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

Since the software update that allows you to use \"Always On\" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off\/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using \"Always On\" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 4.0"}

{"prompt":"Already very practical for overcoming disability issues 26,\n\nWe have been using Echo since April 2015. Prior to that time, my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks. He is currently wheelchair bound. We immediately installed the Hue bridge and lights as well as the WEMO outlet. With these, and dear, dear, Alexa, he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent. Others might enjoy Echo for fun and convenience, but for him it is a lifeline! He has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when I didn't hear him call.We use the shopping list feature a lot, and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered, while I was already at the store. Should I mention he adds things like chocolate bars when I'm not looking No more paper lists! I just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as I check them off.We transport Echo from the living room to the bedroom, since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote, plus it is always there for his favorite music, an update on news, and to check the weather. Or, when he needs cheering up, I ask for a joke. Tosave plugging in behind his lift chairs, I have ordered a second plug. I love the easy reconnect to the WIFI.I was a bit worried at first about his word slurring with his Parkinson's, but it has worked the opposite way! I notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands. After he forgot her name early on, we added it so he could remember using the Zink hAppy App.My granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using Echo, and in addition to the music stations and Amazon play lists, Echo is a breeze to use as a Bluetooth device. I have used it to play my meditation apps and iTunes music.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 5.0"}

{"prompt":"Pretty Good So Far\n\nOk first off, if you are looking to get one of these things dont put all your eggs on one basket as far as other reviewers go. The bad ones I think are just haters, apple lovers, people who dont have one, or have nothing better to do but to not give thing a proper review.I got mine yesterday and had a few hours to play with it and use it. I have XBox 360 and used that for my Netflix and Amazon Prime but wanted something else to do that with. So Amazon came out with this and ordered it. Here is a list of good and bad. But understand I dont own apple or Roku.The Good:1. The speed and response on this thing is VERY VERY fast.2. The video quality is great. It truly is 1080p. I think that is better the what my XBox puts out3. The sound quality is great. I used a HDMI plugged it in to my 5.1 and sounds great.4. The hook up was very easy and straight forward. It is a plug and play.5. Hooking up to home network was very simple. I use the wireless and it so far runs flawlessly.6. The remote is small and very simple and not complicated very straight forward and very smooth.7. The movie and show load up time is very instant. With my Netflix it took no time at all to load up unlike my Xbox.8. This is the best part I thing anyway and so far no has said anything about this is...That you can take it with you on a trip. As long as the T.V has a HDMI and you can get on the wireless you can watch your programs or movies on any T.V. I think that is the best part about it all.9. It is small and very light.10. The voice search works really well.Cons and these may not be cons or bad for you.1. The voice search will only find movies or programs on Amazon Prime. But from what I hear that is cause of a deal thing with the other providers and that may change in the further.2. You can not power it down or put it to sleep. But for me that is no big deal. And really you can just unplug it if you want.Summery:Over all I find this unit works really well and it is very responsive. I have yet to see any lag with the things that I have watched or played with.Note: I have not used the games for this so this is only for the programs. I put it through its paces for the few hours that I have used it and so far I think that Amazon did a pretty good job with this.Note: After looking at the box and reading the back of the box there is a note that says there will be a Spring 2014 update. So my thinking is that the stuff that is missing or things that are not there will be coming soon. Just remember that this JUST came out a few days ago and I am sure that things will only get better in time.\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Almost like Paperwhite v1 all over again 5,\n\nI've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light\/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 3.0"}

Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look.

{"prompt":"Awesome Headphones! Longevity An Issue 764 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nWhile I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Good Value at 79 with a Few Nits 5,\n\nI am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 4.0"}

The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Works great with one critical flaw. (significantly improved) 7,377 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nHaving received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy\/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Unreal performance for 99! I couldn't be happier. 5,816 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No\n\nI'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}

{"prompt":"Great controller with 2 major problems! Not recommended at this point in time...\n\nThis is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 2.0"}
{"prompt":"Easy to use, slick interface, and very responsive. Very happy with purchase.\n\nI've been planning on getting a set top box for the past 2 years but just never found something that had everything I was looking for. Briefly browsing amazon a couple of weeks ago, I noticed they had their own recently release online media streaming device. After looking over the specs and capabilities, I thought it was about time to take the plunge - especially since we've been using Amazon Prime streaming services more and more now that our daughter watches kid shows (i.e. Dora, Umi Zumi, Blues Clues, etc.)Though we've only had it around a week, we're very happy with the purchase. We cut our cable over a year ago so plugging in the computer to the TV every time we wanted to watch something was beginning to get tiresome. Connection was straightforward and simple. On boot, it was automatically logged into our Prime account (not sure how it did this.)The interface is slick and really easy to find what you're looking for. It's very quick (not clunky) when browsing through video options and for some reason I think it looks better (could be mental, I know.) Another neat thing is that the remote doesn't have to have line-of-sight to the front of the box since it utilizes bluetooth. It's all about the simple things. Anyways, we're very happy with this little box.\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" nan"}
{"prompt":"Great product, NEEDS A SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR A VERY ANNOYING PROBLEM. 2,\n\nGreat device it's zippy, has an AWESOME display, great sound for a tablet (rivals\/bests any portable device I currently own, including laptops) has incredible ease of use and I'm basically all-in on the Amazon ecosystem. I know people lament the loss of Google Play, but I'm a simple guy who doesn't actually need absolutely everything. I can watch movies\/videos from the major streaming services I use (Netflix\/Prime), music (Pandora, Spotify, Prime), the various apps I use for fantasy sports, reading emails, ebooks (honestly the main reason I bought this thing), and reddit. That's more or less all I need it to do, and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly.The reason for the 3 star is because, as of this review, the device has the SUPREMELY ANNOYING HABIT OF LOCKING UP. It seems to happen most often when I'm running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off. It occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day, but this is a device that I only use when I'm traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer, so those 1-3 times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities.Example of a recent situation: I'm waiting for my class to start so I'm hanging out at the college library, listening to some stuff on Prime while flipping through reddit, with headphones on. It's time to go in, so I switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag. Except it locks up the screen stops moving, I lose any and all functions to use it, and the music just KEEPS ON PLAYING. I can't shut it off.Read more\n\n###\n\n\n\n===\n\n","completion":" 3.0"}
