# BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google. It's designed to understand the context of words in a sentence by capturing bidirectional relationships between words, allowing it to create contextually rich representations of text.

## Overview

- **Transformer Architecture:** BERT is based on the Transformer architecture, leveraging the encoder part for creating embeddings or representations of words.
  
- **Pre-training Tasks:** BERT is pre-trained using two unsupervised tasks:
  - **Masked Language Model (MLM):** It masks certain words in a sentence and trains the model to predict the masked words based on the context provided by the surrounding words.
  - **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** BERT learns to predict whether a pair of sentences are consecutive or not.

## Mathematics Behind BERT

### Token Embeddings

BERT uses WordPiece embeddings, breaking words into subword units. Each token is represented as a fixed-size vector through an embedding layer.

### Transformer Encoder

BERT employs self-attention mechanisms in multiple layers. The key mathematical elements include:
- **Query (Q) matrix**
- **Key (K) matrix**
- **Value (V) matrix**

These matrices are used to calculate attention scores, which are derived from input embeddings.

### Multi-Head Attention

BERT uses multiple attention heads to learn different relationships between words. Each attention head computes its own Q, K, and V matrices, generating multiple sets of attention-weighted values that are concatenated and processed further.

### Transformer Layers

BERT comprises multiple Transformer layers, each containing self-attention and feed-forward neural network sub-layers. These layers enable the model to capture hierarchical patterns and dependencies in text.

### Fine-tuning

After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks with task-specific datasets, allowing it to perform effectively on various NLP tasks like text classification, question answering, and more.

The mathematical underpinnings of BERT involve complex matrix operations, attention mechanisms, and neural network layers implemented in its Transformer architecture. These operations enable BERT to effectively capture contextual information and generate powerful representations of text, making it highly effective for various NLP tasks.


# GPT Transformers

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are a class of AI language models developed by OpenAI. These models are based on the Transformer architecture and have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: GPT models use a self-attention mechanism that allows them to capture dependencies between different words in a sequence more effectively.
  
- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: GPT models are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to learn the nuances of language. They can be further fine-tuned on specific tasks with additional data for better performance.
  
- **Text Generation and Understanding**: GPT models excel in tasks such as text generation, language understanding, translation, summarization, question-answering, and more.

## Versions

OpenAI has released several versions of the GPT model, including:
- GPT-1
- GPT-2
- GPT-3

Each version differs in model size, training data, and performance, with GPT-3 being one of the largest and most powerful language models available.

## Usage

To use GPT Transformers in your projects, you can leverage libraries like `transformers` in Python. This library provides an easy-to-use interface for working with GPT models, including loading pre-trained models, fine-tuning, and inference.

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')
